# Phase 1 Implementation Plan: Foundation & Core Algorithm Design

Based on analysis of the codebase, here's the plan for Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):

## 2. Build System Modernization ✅ COMPLETED

### Migrate to Vite
- [x] Replace Rollup with Vite configuration - *Created vite.config.ts with ESM support*

- [x] Update to TypeScript 5.x with strict mode - *Updated to TS 5.x with strict: true*
- [x] Set ES2020 target with proper polyfills - *Set target: ES2020 in tsconfig.json*

### Upgrade Dependencies
- [x] Svelte 3.35 → 4.x - *Updated to Svelte 4.x with proper preprocessing*
- [x] Remove wink-nlp (replace with simple tokenization) - *Completed: Replaced with BM25Service tokenizer*
- [x] Update Obsidian API to 1.5.0+ - *Updated to obsidian@^1.5.0*
- [x] Keep Graphology for graph operations - *Retained graphology dependencies*

## 3. Obsidian API Migration

### Update Plugin Structure
- [ ] Update manifest.json minAppVersion to 1.5.0
- [ ] Replace deprecated metadataCache/workspace APIs
- [ ] Implement proper mobile support
- [ ] Update event handling patterns

## 4. Simplified Settings & Constants

### Reduce Complexity
- [ ] Remove 12+ algorithm types from Constants.ts
- [ ] Keep only: exclusion regex/tags, candidate caps
- [ ] Remove complex UI options
- [ ] Focus on three core functions

## Key Implementation Tasks

1. [x] Set up Vite build system with modern tooling - *✅ COMPLETED: Modern Vite build with fast esbuild compilation*
2. [x] Create BM25Service.ts for text indexing/similarity - *✅ COMPLETED: Full BM25F implementation with PR review fixes*
3. [x] Extend MyGraph.ts with RA and PPR algorithms - *✅ COMPLETED: Both Resource Allocation and Personalized PageRank implemented*  
4. [ ] Update manifest and API usage for Obsidian 1.5.0+
5. [ ] Simplify Constants.ts to three algorithm types
6. [x] Remove legacy NLP dependencies (wink-nlp, sentiment) - *✅ COMPLETED: Removed from package.json and replaced functionality*
7. [ ] Create efficient caching layer for computations
8. [x] Implement incremental index updates - *✅ COMPLETED: BM25Service supports add/remove/update operations*

## Focus
This plan focuses on building the foundation for three optimized algorithms while modernizing the tech stack for better performance and maintainability.

### Three Core Functions (from MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md)
1. **"Most similar notes"** → BM25F content + light structural overlap ✅ COMPLETED
2. **"What should this note be linked to?"** → Resource Allocation gated by text relevance ✅ COMPLETED
3. **"What else is worth attention?"** → Personalized PageRank with restart at current note ✅ COMPLETED

🎉 **Phase 1 Core Algorithms: COMPLETE** 
All three primary algorithmic functions have been successfully implemented, tested, and integrated into the UI with proper explanations and performance optimization.
